# Urban Design Guidelines

## Purpose
Buildings shall be designed to provide exceptional livability while raising the bar for aesthetic and finish quality. Building design shall encourage lively, pedestrian-oriented open spaces that attract interest and interaction with the site and building. Buildings shall contribute to street-level activity and a sense of occupancy through the location and animating design of ground floor uses.

### Authority 
Section 19 of the the community zoning ordinance establishes the site plan review process for development applications. This document, the the community design guidelines (guidelines), establishes the design and planning standards as the basis for the site plan review process.

### Approach 
The community’s pace of redevelopment is accelerating. The city must ensure that changes serve the local community and provide a predictable process for applicants.

These guidelines support the community’s ambition to become a more walkable, transit-friendly, and mixed-use community by ensuring consistently high-quality site and architectural design throughout the community. The desired outcome is technologically and economically viable urban places. These guidelines also address pre-existing conditions related to existing uses and buildings.

The guidelines are primarily principle-based rather than strictly prescriptive. This affords applicants the flexibility to design creatively while achieving and maintaining a high level of quality and continuity throughout the community.

### Applicability
Because the design guidelines apply citywide over a wide range of building scales, such as from 4 dwelling units up to 300 dwelling units.
## Urban design
*The starting point for urban design in the community is the pedestrian experience. Buildings and spaces shall enhance the quality of the pedestrian environment and be compatible with the surrounding area.*

### Context

Developments shall be responsive to the existing pattern of development, including overall image, scale, and character.

**Context area map** 
Provide a context map extending at least ¼-mile beyond the site that identifies:
- Building footprints, parcel lines, street names, water bodies, schools, community facilities, and commercial/retail areas
- Landmark features such as towers, vertical elements, building entries, and public open spaces
- View corridors (e.g., down rights-of-way or across open spaces)

**Site survey**
Submit a registered survey showing 2-ft topography, all trees ≥ 6-in. caliper, significant natural features, structures, paved surfaces, and utilities.

**Responding to the context**
- Align building setbacks and heights with the established streetscape
- Accentuate corner and view-terminating buildings as visual landmarks
- Mitigate or minimize adverse impacts on any historic resources
- Preserve existing mature trees wherever possible&#x20;

### Connections

Provide safe, convenient movement for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users and add new public links where appropriate.

- Submit a connections map (minimum ¼-mile radius)
- Show sidewalks, trails, open spaces, transit stops/lines, and bicycle facilities
- Design sites and buildings to encourage on-site and between-site pedestrian/bicycle movement
- Give direct pedestrian paths between transit stops and riders
- Blocks > 400 ft long must include a 24/7 public mid-block passage from one street sidewalk to the opposite side
- Mid-block passages may be open-air or covered if public access is maintained
- Design mid-block connections to reach useful destinations and link to open-space networks&#x20;

### Site design and open space

Site design shall integrate with adjacent streets, create clear public-to-private transitions, and use best-practice storm-water strategies. Larger projects must expand the community’s public-realm network.

**Public–private transitions**
- Match or exceed adjacent streetscape materials in setbacks, plazas, and connections
- Clearly delineate public/semi-private/private zones (walls, hedges, grade change, etc.)
- Fences must use materials and colors consistent with the design intent

**Open spaces**
- Dedicate ≥ 15 % of commercial or mixed-use sites to publicly-accessible open space (parking and buildings excluded); mid-block passages count
- Encourage pavilions, kiosks, rest-rooms, etc. within public spaces
- Design spaces to enhance existing/planned open-space networks

**Storm-water management**
- Prevent off-site discharge (to the 95th-percentile storm) with LID measures (rain gardens, porous paving, etc.)

**Wind**
- Use building/open-space layout and conifers to block prevailing winds and downdrafts
- Buildings ≥ 150 ft or twice the height of neighbors may require wind-tunnel testing

**Sun & shadow**
- Minimize shadows on homes and public open space
- Provide shadow studies for four dates (3-21, 5-6, 6-21, 12-21) from 1.5 hrs after sunrise to 1.5 hrs before sunset
- Favor deciduous trees on south façades for summer shade/winter sun
- Prefer south-facing outdoor seating/dining areas

**Winter-city design**
- Create nighttime interest with thoughtful lighting (intensity, spread, color)
- Texture or cover ramps/stairs to reduce snow / ice hazards
- Design surface lots for snow storage with proper drainage
- Provide seating or shelter in public-art installations in high-traffic areas

### Complete streets

Use a complete-street approach for any frontage or right-of-way work. Provide for walking, cycling, transit, driving, and social interaction.

**Sidewalks & uses**
- Sidewalks on both sides of every street; clear walk-zone ≥ 6 ft (≥ 10 ft in high-traffic areas)
- Where shops/cafés front the street, the clear walk-zone shall abut the building edge
- Outdoor café seating allowed if a 4-ft clear path remains; use durable movable furniture
- Shrubs at property lines must be low to maintain sightlines

**Transit facilities**
- On-street stops must handle peak loads without impeding pedestrian flow
- Light stops with pedestrian-scale fixtures
- Provide high-quality shelters

**Bicycle facilities**
- Design lanes per MassDOT Separated Bike-Lane Guide
- Install on-street racks (≥ 4 spaces) at least every 500 ft

**Crosswalks**
- Extend all sidewalk trajectories across intersections with contrasting surfacing
- Locate crosswalks near transit stops
- Add curb extensions where on-street parking exists

**Roadway & streetscape**
- Keep vehicular lanes/shoulders/parking to MassDOT minimum widths
- Garage/lot drive curb cuts ≤ 20 ft; residential driveways ≤ 10 ft
- Maintain sidewalk grade across driveways (create speed-table)
- Space street trees ≈ 30 ft o/c, min. 10-ft height & 3-in. caliper at planting
- Place 10-15 ft street lights ≈ 100 ft o/c at sidewalk edge
- Provide benches along retail frontages (≥ 1 per block face)
- Arrange benches facing each other near curb
- Allow built-in benches to project ≤ 2 ft into sidewalk
- Provide drinking fountains at every park/playground
- Place utilities underground where feasible in Upgrade/Transform areas&#x20;

## Building design
Buildings shall be designed to provide exceptional livability while raising the bar for aesthetic and f inish quality. Building design shall encourage lively, pedestrian-oriented open spaces that attract interest and interaction with the site and building. Buildings shall contribute to street-level activity and a sense of occupancy through the location and animating design of ground floor uses.

### Ground floors

Ground floors shall enliven the public realm, create interesting pedestrian journeys, ensure privacy for residential uses, and screen service areas from public streets and parks.

**Location of ground-floor uses**
- Within 70 feet of the primary frontage lot line, ground floor areas shall be routinely occupiable by people engaged in activities related to the building’s uses, such as retail, service businesses, classrooms, building lobbies, residential units, professional offices, manufacturing, and research. 
- More active interiors must align with more active public spaces.
- Locate ground-floor residential next to residential neighbors.
- Ground-floor residential must be ≥ 100 ft from roads > 40 mph.

**Setbacks**
- Residential ground floors may set back for yards/forecourts
- Non-residential setbacks should add usable public space with seating, furniture, art, shade, etc.

**Entrances**
- Place primary entrances on public streets.
- Align entrances with safe walking routes/crosswalks/transit stops.
- Provide at least one street-facing entrance where a building abuts a street.
- Each retail tenant must have its own public entrance.

**Retail regulations**
- Retail façades must be ≥ 60 % glazing; food/drink venues should consider operable street-facing doors.
- Use warm-spectrum lighting; avoid flat washes.
- Provide 15–100 sq ft entrance alcoves paved to match sidewalk.
- Large floorplate retail (greater than 10,000 leasable square feet) shall consider setting back the larger floor plate use to accommodate smaller commercial spaces along the frontage and, if relevant, properly address the public realm to support active street life.
- Stand-alone retail buildings are discouraged. If stand-alone retail is unavoidable, the building shall have a distinctive roofline and be adaptable for changes in future users. Upper story mezzanines and terraces are recommended.

**Service areas**
- Mechanical equipment, refuse storage, service areas, and loading areas not entirely enclosed within buildings shall (1) be located outside required setbacks and not within 10 feet of any property line, (2) be permanently screened from view from adjacent public streets and parks and from abutting property under separate ownership when on the ground, and (3) meet all city, state and federal noise regulations.

### Massing

Frame public space and harmonize with context through appropriate orientation, articulation, and height transitions.

- Keep ground-level mass parallel to streets
- Upper stories may vary if street/p-space enclosure is maintained
- Provide courtyards to daylight interior façades
- Break large façades to avoid “wall” appearance
- Articulate façades every 60 ft at ground level (offsets, projections, recesses)
- Visually distinguish podium from upper stories
- Step heights down toward nearby lower-scale residential zones
- Facing such zones, a principal wall cornice may exceed the zone’s height limit by ≤ 20 ft before stepping back&#x20;

### Parking

Give priority to walking, cycling, and transit; minimize parking’s visual/functional impact.

**Bicycle parking**
- Provide visitor/resident bicycle parking as convenient as car parking
- For non-residential uses, supply spaces at City-specified rates
- For residential uses, supply long-term and visitor bike parking

**Motor-vehicle access & surface parking**
- Prohibit surface parking between building fronts and streets/parks
- Limit one access drive per 100 ft of frontage
- Encourage shared drives with neighbors
- Locate drives on side streets when possible

**Parking garages**
- Place garages within the block interior, screened from streets/parks
- Provide direct pedestrian/wheeled access from a public street
- Design garages for shared or public use where feasible&#x20;

### Amenity space

Multi-family buildings must foster social interaction through indoor and outdoor shared spaces.

**Amenity-space requirements**
- Buildings with ≥ 10 units: provide ≥ 25 sq ft of public, private-outdoor, or shared amenity space per unit
- Shared amenity space may not occupy required setbacks unless abutting a public park
- Each shared amenity space must be ≥ 500 sq ft

**Locations & uses**
- Site amenity areas to animate streets and add “eyes on the street”
- Use courtyards, rear yards, terraces, and roofs for outdoor amenity (patios, play areas, gardens, etc.)
- Design outdoor areas for visibility from units while mitigating noise/conflict
- Locate interior shared spaces along common paths and with good natural light&#x20;

### Compact living

Applies to new developments of ≥ 10 units below the following sizes: studio ≤ 500 sf, 1-BR ≤ 650 sf, 2-BR ≤ 850 sf, 3-BR ≤ 950 sf.

- Follow compact-living regulations when unit sizes fall below thresholds

- Locate compact-living projects within ¼ mi of frequent-service bus or ½ mi of rapid transit
- Design to support a car-free lifestyle (bike facilities, quality transit, safe walking)
- Ensure ample storage (in-unit or common); consider lending libraries or similar solutions&#x20;

### Roofs

Roofs must reinforce the design intent for pedestrians and screen mechanical systems.

**Roofline**
- Shape/define building entries and corners
- May include distinct forms, cornices, eaves, parapets
- Dormers must be habitable and no larger than needed for windows/framing
- Align solar panels with roof form and integrate where possible
- Design to prevent ice/snow from falling onto entries/walkways

**Horizontal roof uses**
- All other flat roof areas must be vegetated green roof, 24/7 accessible amenity space, or both (with views to edge)

**Screening**
- Paint vent stacks and other protrusions to match roof/façade
- Screen mechanical equipment with parapets, cupolas, or dormers&#x20;

### Architectural materials and details

Materials and details must harmonize with surroundings and convey durable, high-quality design.

**360° design**

- Design tops of canopies to avoid unsightly conditions/glare to upper floors
- Ground-level attachments limited to weather protection; above 2nd floor may project (balconies, bays, signs, etc.) with clearance—≥ 15 ft over roadways, ≥ 7 ft over sidewalks
- Prohibit visible antennas or radar dishes

**Material mock-ups**
- Submit full-scale on-site mock-ups of every exterior material, window, façade base, and top with construction documents for Planning Review&#x20;
